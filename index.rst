1.4 Internal and External Links
--------------------------------

In Sphinx, you have 3 type of links:

    1. External links (http-like)
    2. Implicit links to title
    3. Explicit links to user-defined label (e.g., to refer to external titles).
    
1.4.1. External Links
""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you want to create a link to a website, the syntax is 

`Python <http://www.python.org>`_

1.4.2. Implicit Links to Titles
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

All titles are considered as hyperlinks. A link to a title is just its name within quotes and a final underscore:
